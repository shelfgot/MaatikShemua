# Optional kraken / HTR requirements
#
# These are only needed if you want to run the full
# OCR/HTR pipeline locally. They currently target
# Python versions up to 3.11 and are NOT required
# for running the FastAPI app, database, or tests.
#
# Install on a compatible Python (e.g. 3.11) or in
# a container:
#   pip install -r requirements.txt
#   pip install -r requirements-kraken.txt
#
# Then configure kraken-related settings as needed.
